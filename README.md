# Guidance for Troubleshooting of Amazon EKS using Agentic AI workflow on AWS

This guidance provides an example of Platform Engineering approach to troubleshooting Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) issues using Agentic AI workflow integrated with ChatOps via Slack

 **Strands-based AI Agentic workflow Troubleshooting**: An intelligent agent using AWS [Strands Agent framework](http://strandsagents.com/latest/) with [EKS MCP server](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/eks-mcp-server) integration for real-time troubleshooting

It can be deployed using [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform), which provisions all necessary AWS resources including EKS cluster with compute plane, required add-ons, monitoring tools, and the agentic troubleshooting agent.

## Architecture

### Reference Architecture - EKS Cluster

_Figure 1: Guidance for Troubleshooting of Amazon EKS using Agentic AI workflow on AWS - Reference Architecture_

### Reference Architecture Steps

1. **Amazon EKS Cluster**: Managed Kubernetes control plane and worker nodes running containerized workloads, providing the foundation for the agentic troubleshooting system.

2. **Agentic Troubleshooting Agent**: Strands-based multi-agent system deployed as pods in the EKS cluster, orchestrating intelligent troubleshooting workflows through specialized agents.

3. **Amazon Bedrock Integration**: Provides foundational AI models (Claude for analysis, Titan Embeddings for semantic search) for natural language processing and intelligent troubleshooting recommendations.

4. **S3 Vectors Knowledge Base**: Stores vector embeddings of historical troubleshooting cases, enabling semantic search and knowledge retrieval for similar past issues.

5. **EKS MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol server enabling real-time Kubernetes cluster interaction, allowing agents to execute kubectl commands and gather cluster state information.

6. **Slack Integration**: ChatOps interface using Socket Mode for real-time user interaction, allowing DevOps teams to troubleshoot issues through natural language conversations.

7. **Monitoring & Observability**: Prometheus and Grafana stack for cluster health monitoring, metrics collection, and alerting to Slack channels.

_Figure 2: Guidance for Troubleshooting of Amazon EKS using Agentic AI workflow on AWS - Troubleshooting Workflow_

### Agentic AI Workflow Architecture Steps

1. **Setup** - Agentic troubleshooting agent is deployed into an Amazon EKS cluster, configured with proper IAM permissions, Slack integration, and access to Amazon Bedrock and S3 Vectors knowledge base.

2. **User Interaction** - Users (DevOps engineers, SREs, developers) who encounter Kubernetes (K8s) issues send troubleshooting requests through designated Slack channel integrated with K8s Troubleshooting AI Agent. Its components are running as containers on EKS cluster deployed from previously built images hosted in Elastic Container registry (ECR) via [Helm](https://helm.sh/) charts that reference the services-built images

3. **Message Reception & Slack Integration** - Slack establishes a WebSocket connection (Socket Mode) to the Orchestrator agent running in the EKS cluster, enabling real-time bidirectional communication.

4. **Intelligent Message Classification & Orchestration** - Orchestrator agent receives users' message and calls [Nova Micro](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ai/responsible-ai/nova-micro-lite-pro/overview.html) model via Amazon Bedrock API to determine whether the message requires K8s troubleshooting. If an issue is classified as K8s-related, the Orchestrator agent initiates a workflow by delegating tasks to specialized agents while maintaining overall session context.

5. **Historical Knowledge Retrieval** - Orchestrator agent invokes the Memory agent, which connects to Amazon S3 Vectors based knowledge base to search for similar troubleshooting cases for precise issue classification

6. **Semantic Vector Matching** - The Memory agent invokes [Titan Embeddings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/titan-embedding-models.html) model via Amazon Bedrock API to generate semantic embeddings and perform vector similarity matching against the shared S3 Vectors knowledge base

7. **Real-Time Cluster Intelligence** - Orchestrator agent invokes the K8s Specialist agent, which utilizes the hosted [AWS EKS Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-mcp-introduction.html) to execute commands against the EKS API Server. The Client of MCP Server gathers real-time cluster state, pod logs, events, and resource metrics to better "understand" the current problem context.

8. **Intelligent Issue Analysis** - K8s Specialist agent sends the collected cluster data to Anthropic Claude model via Amazon Bedrock for intelligent issue analysis and resolution generation. 

9. **Comprehensive Solution Synthesis** - Orchestrator agent synthesizes the historical context received from Memory agent and current cluster state from K8s Specialist, then uses Claude model via Amazon Bedrock to generate comprehensive troubleshooting recommendations, which are stored in S3 Vectors for future reference.

10. **ChatOps Integration** - Orchestrator agent generates troubleshooting recommendations and sends them back to the Users via integrated Slack channel. This illustrates an increasingly popular "ChatOps" Platform Engineering pattern.

## Security

When you build systems on AWS infrastructure, security responsibilities are shared between you and AWS.
This [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) reduces your
operational burden because AWS operates, manages, and controls the components including the host operating system, the
virtualization layer, and the physical security of the facilities in which the services operate. For more information
about AWS security, visit [AWS Cloud Security](http://aws.amazon.com/security/).

This guidance implements several security best practices and AWS services to enhance the security posture of your EKS
Workload Ready Cluster. Here are the key security components and considerations:

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- **EKS Managed Node Groups**: These use IAM roles with specific permissions required for nodes to join the cluster and for pods to access AWS services.
- **EKS Pod Identity**: The agentic troubleshooting agent uses EKS Pod Identity for secure, least-privilege access to AWS services including Bedrock, S3 Vectors, CloudWatch, and EKS APIs.

### Network Security

- **Amazon VPC**: The EKS cluster is deployed within a custom VPC with public and private subnets across multiple
  Availability Zones, providing network isolation.
- **Security Groups**: Although not explicitly shown in the diagram, security groups are typically used to control
  inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances and other resources within the VPC.
- **NAT Gateways**: Deployed in public subnets to allow outbound internet access for resources in private subnets while
  preventing inbound access from the internet.

### Data Protection

- **Amazon EBS Encryption**: EBS volumes used by EC2 instances are typically encrypted to protect data at rest.
- **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**: Used for managing encryption keys for various services, including EBS volume
  encryption.

### Kubernetes-specific Security

- **Kubernetes RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control is implemented within the EKS cluster to manage fine-grained access to Kubernetes resources.
- **EKS Access Entries**: The agentic agent uses EKS access entries with cluster admin policy for full cluster access required for troubleshooting operations.

### Secrets Management

- **Kubernetes Secrets**: Slack credentials (bot token, app token, signing secret) are stored as Kubernetes secrets and mounted into the agent pods.

### Additional Security Considerations

- Regularly update and patch EKS clusters, compute nodes, and container images.
- Implement network policies to control pod-to-pod communication within the cluster.
- Use Pod Security Policies or Pod Security Standards to enforce security best practices for pods.
- Implement proper logging and auditing mechanisms for both AWS and Kubernetes resources.
- Regularly review and rotate IAM and Kubernetes RBAC permissions.
